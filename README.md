# Aternos-24/7
A bot to keep your Aternos server online 24/7, made in Python with ~love~ code. This project is based on [YTFort/24-Aternos](https://github.com/YTFort/24-Aternos), thanks to [@Forcote](https://www.youtube.com/@Fortcote)! This project has some advantages over the original project including:
- Prebuilt binaries
- Better translations & logging system
- Fix for button presses breaking the bot
- Support for creative so the bot doesn't die

## Usage
### Source code
To run the bot using the source code download the source code from the [releases](https://github.com/BlueSchnabeltier/aternos-247/releases). Then run the following command in the directory of the code:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then adjust the config.ini to your liking. After you can run the following command to start the bot GUI:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Prebuilt binaries
If you are using one of the prebuilt binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/BlueSchnabeltier/aternos-247/releases). Then run it once and then edit the config.ini file in the same directory to your liking. After that, the bot GUI is ready to be used.
