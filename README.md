# Aternos-24/7
A bot to keep your Aternos server online 24/7, made in Python with ~love~ code. This project is based on [YTFort/24-Aternos](https://github.com/YTFort/24-Aternos), thanks to [@Forcote](https://www.youtube.com/@Fortcote)! This project has some advantages over the original project including:
- Better translations & logging system
